Former la masia graduate and one of the most promising players in his position the carrear of Alejandro Grimaldo was looking like a sort of flop. He did become one of the best players in Benfica and in Portugal the 
time he was there but he looked to be destined for far greater things. Knowing that he was going to be free the return to his house in Barcelona was an option but after the frustrated signature of Fran Garcia by Leverkusen he 
was the choosen one and boy did he delivered.

This is Alejandro Grimaldo an Spanish left back that is already 28 years old and that can be considered the best left back in the world right now. He went to Leverkusen on a free but now is worth around 34 million.

After a very good season as usual in the Portuguese first divition he went to Leverkusen and in half a season has broken last years 14 goal contributions in portugal, with 17 in this half a season in Germany. For a left back these numbers
are mindblowing, and this is due to Xabi Alonso's side playing with very high fullbacks almost like wingers but still he has more goal contributions than the likes of Vinicius Junior. Could he win the Bundesliga with Leverkusen this season?
