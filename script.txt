This player has been a very consistent performer for a very long time. After a very disapointing season last year, it looked like maybe Son wasn't the same anymore. But in Postecoglu's Tottenham he has been shining alongside Maddison. And he is now one of the best attacking players in the League.

This is Heung-Min Son, a highly skilled Korean forward currently playing for Tottenham Hotspur at the age of 31, with a transfer value of 55 million euros, known for his lightning quick speed and exceptional dribbling ability on the pitch. Despite being in the prime of his career, he still has a lot to offer and is considered one of the best attackers in the Premier League

Heung-min Son's season has been nothing short of impressive, with an average SofaScore rating of 7.64. The South Korean forward has played 28 matches, finding the back of the net 15 times, while providing 9 assists. Son's shot output per game is among the best in the league at 2.5, while his big chances created are equally impressive with 17. Additionally, he ranks as one of the top forwards in expected goals and expected assisted goals, while also being among the best in pass completion percentage, shots on target, and through balls. Son's standout performances this season include his one-goal, two-assist display against Newcastle, which earned him a rating of 9.5, and his one-goal, two-assist effort against Aston Villa, which earned him a rating of 9.1. These outings demonstrate Son's ability to produce high-quality performances on a consistent basis, making him one of the most dangerous forwards in the league. His consistency and experience make him a vital player for his team, and he could be a key factor in their push for a top-four finish.
