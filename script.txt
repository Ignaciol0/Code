We all know him an most of us think he deserved last years ballon d'or. We are going to talk about Erling Haaland. Is he having a bad season as the media seems to think? Or is he just not at the level of last year but still world class?

Erling Haaland, the young Norwegian striker for Manchester City at the age of 23, has been making headlines with his incredible goal-scoring record in the Premier League. With a transfer value of 196 million euros, he is one of the most expensive players in the world and considered to be one of the top strikers in the game today.

Erling Haaland has had a highly productive season, with a SofaScore average rating of 7.29. The Norwegian striker has demonstrated his goal-scoring prowess, netting 24 times in 31 matches. His tally of 4.3 shots per game is among the highest in the league, indicating his ability to create chances for himself and his teammates. However, Haaland has also struggled with missing big chances, with 39 misses this season. Despite these lapses, he has shown his quality with standout performances against Manchester Everton and Man Brentford, where he scored 2 goals and 0 assists respectively, earning him ratings of 8.7 and 8.2 for those matches. Overall, Haaland's season has been impressive, highlighting his potency in front of goal and his ability to produce high-quality displays when needed. So overall this season is not his brightests and he is the best assisted stricker in the world but in my opinion he is still world class.
