Isco is one of those players that we thought we would never see again. He has spent since the 17-18 season without playing well for Real Madrid. And then when he got out no one signed him for 6 months. He managed to go to Seville where he ended up as a flop, and this looked like the moment to hang the boots. But then the other club in Sevilla showed interest. Betis offered Isco a chance and now the rest is history.

Isco is a 31-year-old Spanish midfielder currently playing for Real Betis, despite his age he still possesses exceptional skill and creativity on the pitch with a transfer value of 8.3 million euros. Despite being overlooked by some, he has consistently delivered impressive performances this season, cementing his place as one of the top players in La Liga.

Isco's season has been sublimal this season, with an average SofaScore rating of 7.45. The Spanish midfielder has played 31 matches, finding the back of the net seven times, while providing six assists. He also makes a significant number of recoveries, with 4.3 per match, indicating his work rate and defensive capabilities. However, he misses a significant number of big chances, with 13, which could have potentially increased his goal tally. Isco's standout performances this season include his two-goal display against Barcelona, which earned him a rating of 8.5, and his one-assist effort against Celta Vigo, which earned him a rating of 8.3. These outings demonstrate Isco's ability to produce high-quality performances on a consistent basis, although he may not be at the same level as when he was at Real Madrid. Nonetheless, his experience and consistency make him an important player for his team, particularly in big matches. It is worth noting that Isco has been named to the Team of the Week twice this season, which speaks to his overall quality and contribution to his team's success.
